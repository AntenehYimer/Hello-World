# Hello-World
Well as part of my discovery of Github, here is a lesson on how to make and commit changes on my "master" file.
I have alrady crated a branch so now by comitting changes, I will be able to explain why I have made a particular changes (this that I am writing now) and so that you as a contributor will be able to undrestand the history of the change and what I have done and why.
